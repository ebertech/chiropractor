# Chiropractor

I miss ActiveSupport. I really do. The javascript standard library is lacking. So this is a collection of some useful Backbone and Underscore components. Saves me from having to keep downloading them into every project. This seems like a reasonable stack that gives you pretty powerful framework for building backbone apps.

Included:

* Underscore.Inflector: https://github.com/jeremyruppel/underscore.inflection
* Underscore.String: https://github.com/epeli/underscore.string
* Backbone.Marionette: https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette
* Backbone.Relational: https://github.com/PaulUithol/Backbone-relational
* Backbone.ModelBinder: https://github.com/theironcook/Backbone.ModelBinder
* AccountingJS: http://josscrowcroft.github.com/accounting.js/
* MomentJS: https://github.com/timrwood/moment/

Also have a couple extensions:

* Backbone.LayoutRegion: Combines Layouts and Regions from Marionette
* Backbone.JST: Adds JST support to Marionette
